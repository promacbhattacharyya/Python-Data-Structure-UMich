# 7.1 Write a program that prompts for a file name, then opens that file and reads through the file, and print the contents of the file in upper case. 
# Use the file (words.txt)
# You can download the sample data at http://www.py4e.com/code3/words.txt

# Prompting for a file name
fname = input("Enter file name: ")

# Opening a file
fh = open(fname)

# Removing whitespace and converting strings to upper case
for line in fh:
    line = line.rstrip()
    upperfile = line.upper()
    print(upperfile)
