# 6.5 Write code using find() and string slicing (see section 6.10) to extract the number at the end of the line below. 
Convert the extracted value to a floating point number and print it out

# Input Line
text = "X-DSPAM-Confidence:    0.8475";

# Finding the position of the  ' '(space) within the provided line
FPosition = text.find(' ')

# Slicing the string to extract the number
number = float(text[20:])
print (number)
